I am a Computer Science educator and researcher, soon to begin my role as a Post-doc Researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi. Previously, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Canadian University Dubai, teaching Theory of Computing and Cloud Computing, and I spent five years as an Instructor and Teaching Assistant at the University of Calgary, focusing on Software Engineering.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, where my research on structural generalization of code using APIs was recently published in the Journal of Systems and Software. I earned my M.Sc. and B.Sc. from the American University in Cairo, with my master's thesis on multiple document summarization using graph-based text representation.

My research interests include using Artificial Intelligence to advance Software Engineering processes and tools, with a human-centric approach. Currently, I am exploring the use of LLMs in Software Engineering and AI in educational technologies.

With five years of industry experience at institutions like the American University in Cairo and Microsoft Research in Cairo, I recently co-founded Sagacity Consulting, focusing on innovative AI transformation and education solutions. My goals include advancing my research, starting a professorship, and growing my company.

I am also a wife and mother of two, with hobbies that include reading, watching TV, listening to music, and learning new languages. Currently bilingual, I aspire to become a polyglot.
