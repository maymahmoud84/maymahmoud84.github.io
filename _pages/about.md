I am a Computer Science eduator and reseracher, currently preapring for my position as a Post-doc Researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi. Previsouly, I was a Visiting Assitant Professor at the Canadian University Dubai, where I taught theory of computing and cloud computing courses. I also worked as an Instructor and Teaching Assitant at the University of Calgary teaching various courses with focus on Software Engineering.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Scince at the University of Calgary, where I reserached the use of structural generalization of code using API to generate API usage templates. My reserach focused on the theory of anti-unification of the abstract syntax tree of the code. I recently published my work in the Jornal of Systems and Software. I recieved my Ms.c. from the American University in Cairo, where I also obtained my Bsc. My masters thesis focused on the summization of multiple document using graph-based representation of the text.

My research interest focus on the use of Artificial Intelligence in advancing Software Engineering processes and tools, making developers life easier. I aim to have a human-centeric approach to software engineering problem, focusing on the issues from the deverlopers and software engineers presepctive. I am also interested in the use of AI in educational technologies. My current focus is on reseraching the use of LLMs in Software Engineering.

I hold a five year industry experience where I worked as a Student Information System Specialist at the American University in Cairo, a Research Software Development Engineer at Microsoft Research in Cairo and as Software Egnieering in at ITWorx Egypt. I recently explored my entrepreneurship skills where I co-founded Sagacity Consulting in the UAE, where focus on developing innovative solutions in AI transformation and education.
