Previously, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Canadian University Dubai, where I taught Theory of Computing and Cloud Computing courses. I also worked as an Instructor and a Teaching Assistant at the University of Calgary for five years, teaching various courses with a focus on Software Engineering.</p> <p>I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, where I researched the use of structural generalization of code using APIs to generate API usage templates. My research focused on the use of the theory of anti-unification in the context of generalizing the abstract syntax tree of similar code snippets to produce code templates. I recently published my work in the Journal of Systems and Software. I received my M.Sc. from the American University in Cairo, where I also obtained my B.Sc. My master’s thesis focused on the summarization of multiple documents using a graph-based representation of the text.</p> <p>My research interests focus on the use of Artificial Intelligence in advancing Software Engineering processes and tools, making developers’ lives easier. I aim to have a human-centric approach to software engineering problems, focusing on issues from the developers’ and software engineers’ perspectives. I am also interested in the use of AI in educational technologies. My current focus is on researching the use of LLMs in Software Engineering.</p> <p>I have five years of industry experience, where I worked as a Student Information System Specialist at the American University in Cairo, a Research Software Development Engineer at Microsoft Research in Cairo, and a Software Engineer at ITWorx Egypt. I recently explored my entrepreneurial skills by co-founding Sagacity Consulting in 2022, where we focus on developing innovative solutions in AI transformation and education.</p> <p>My goals are to solidify my research track record, start my professorship at a reputable institute, and grow my company to be a profitable business with a steady clientele.</p> <p>I am a wife and a mother of two kids, a 13-year-old boy and a 6-year-old daughter. I like to read, watch TV, and listen to music. I also have an interest in learning new languages. Currently, I am bilingual, with a dream to be a polyglot one da</p> </body></html>
