I am an Egyptian Canadian, grew up in Cairo, Egypt, and moved to Canada in 2015. I currently reside in Dubai, UAE with my family. I am a mother of two, 13-years old boy and a six-years old daughter. My hobbies includes reading, watching TV, listening to music, and learning new languages. Currently bilingual, I aspire to become a polyglot. Among the language I am currently trying to learn are Turkish, Korean and Mandarin. I previously studies French and German for many years.
